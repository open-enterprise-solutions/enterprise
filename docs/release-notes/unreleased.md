# Unreleased

Since [v2.0.0-preview.1](v2.0.0-preview.1.md).

## Fixes

- **A list filtered by «contains» finds the rows that contain the value.** On a list read from the
  base the condition reached the database as `LIKE 'value'`, an exact match, so "Comment contains
  Оплат" showed nothing and only "%Оплат%" worked. The value is now wrapped as `%value%`, as the
  same condition already was in memory; a `%` or `_` typed into the value is still a wildcard. The
  query language's own `LIKE` is unchanged and takes its pattern as written.
- **A server whose base and `backend.conf` name no language speaks US English**, not the language of
  the machine it runs on, so the same server answers the same words everywhere. A language named
  and not installed on the machine falls back to US English too.
